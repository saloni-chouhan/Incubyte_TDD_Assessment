# String Calculator TDD Kata

This project demonstrates the implementation of the String Calculator TDD Kata using Ruby on Rails, following the three laws of Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## The Three Laws of TDD

1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and compilation failures are failures.
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.
